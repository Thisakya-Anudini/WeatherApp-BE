# Weather App - Backend

## Overview

The **Backend** of the **Weather App** is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It is responsible for handling API requests, fetching weather data from the **OpenWeather API**, and serving it to the **Frontend**. This backend also handles user authentication and the **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** process.

The backend is designed to communicate seamlessly with the frontend, process requests efficiently, and ensure secure login with 2FA.
